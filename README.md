## Introduction

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project was used as the final work of the **Software Project** discipline, of the Information Systems course at Universidade Federal Fluminense. The goal of the project is to implement **Ticket to Ride, a board game**, using Next JS and OOP principles. 

**Group Members:** Rachel Barino, Gabrielle,
Daniel Izu, Vinícius Jimenez, Caio Lima e Gabriel Machado.

### NOTE: currently the project is being developed in dev branch

## Getting Started

First, you'll need Node JS installed in your computer. You can find more information about Node in: 
https://www.nodejs.tech/pt-br/download

Then, you'll need to download the project's dependencies by executing:

```bash
pnpm install
#or
npm install
```

in the command prompt or PowerShell.



First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
